By using pre-qualification before applying, you can see available credit card offers that match your credit profile. Instead of submitting a full credit card application that triggers a hard inquiry on your credit report, financial institutions usually will place a soft inquiry on your credit report when you request pre-qualified offers, but check with financial institution. Soft inquiries won’t impact your credit score, but hard inquiries can. Pre-qualified credit card offers help you find the right card for you. Prepare your full credit card application. Using a pre-approval process can help gather the information that will build your full application, meaning your application is much easier to complete because the information you submitted when you requested your pre-approved offer is already on file."

            receive them electronically. There will be no fees or penalties for withdrawal of your consent. You can

    <h4 class="field-label"><b>Will checking for pre-approved offers harm my credit?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    No. There’s no harm to your credit score to see if you're pre-approved.
                    And you could see the APR and offers you may qualify for before you apply.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>What is the difference between a soft inquiry and a hard inquiry?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Soft inquiries usually occur when lenders are
                    considering you for pre-approved offers by
                    mail or online. Only you and your credit bureau can see them on your credit report,
                    and soft inquiries don’t affect your credit
                    score. Hard inquiries typically occur when you apply for a credit card, mortgage or other
                    loan. Other lenders can see hard inquires,
                    and hard inquiries could affect your credit score.

                <p>
                    We need your personal information to see if you qualify for a credit card offer and to verify your
                    identity. Remember, there’s no harm to your credit to check.

    <h4 class="field-label"><b>Why should I check if I&#39;m pre-approved?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    You could see the APR and offers you may qualify for before you apply, based on
                    your credit report and other information. And
                    there’s no harm to your credit to check. If we
                    don't have an offer for you, we'll tell you why.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>What’s the difference between pre-approved, pre-selected and pre-qualified?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Lenders may use a variety of terms to describe the process of determining whether you may be
                    eligible for loans. Both pre-qualified and pre-approved offers use a review of your financial
                    profile to understand your eligibility to qualify and be approved when you submit an application.
                    Discover's pre-approval form requires only basic financial information, including your social
                    security number, current income, housing status and bank account status.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>Are pre-approved offers guaranteed?</b></h4>

                        </a>
                    </span> are not guaranteed. You’ll still need to complete a full application for final
                    decision.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>How does the pre-approval process work? </b></h4>
                <div>
                    <p>Process has three quick and easy steps:</p>
                    <p>Step 1 – Fill out the form to check for card offers with no impact to your credit</p>
                    <p>Step 2 – Select your customized pre-approved card offer</p>
                    <p>Step 3 – Add any other required information and apply, when a hard inquiry will be placed on your
                        credit report</p>
                </div>
        </div>

    </div>
    <div id="pre-approval-offer-expandable-item" class="top-border expandable-item-container">
        <a class="expandable-item-title">
            <h3><b>Pre-Approval Offers</b></h3>
        </a>
        <div class="expandable-item-description-container">
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>How long are pre-approved offers valid?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    You have 7 days to apply for your pre-approved offer before it expires. After that,
                    you can <a id="fq-form-page-link" class="link">request a new pre-approved offer</a>.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>Can I request a pre-approved offer over the phone?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Currently, pre-approved offers are only available online.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>What if I&#39;m not pre-approved for any offers?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    If we don't have an offer for you, we'll tell you why. And you're welcome to come back
                    and submit another pre-approval request after 8 days.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>Why should you check your pre-qualified offers?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Your pre-qualified (or pre-approved) offers show you which credit card offers issuers think you’ll
                    qualify for. By comparing pre-qualified offers across different credit card issuers, you can find
                    the best rates and benefits for you. You can see your pre-qualified offers by checking a credit
                    card website for ‘pre-approved offers’ or ‘pre-qualified offers’. Checking for pre-qualified credit
                    card offers will usually not impact your credit score because financial institutions place a soft
                    inquiry on your credit report when checking your eligibility, but be sure to check the issuers’
                    websites for details. When you apply for a pre-approved offer, however, the issuer will place a
                    hard inquiry on your credit report, which could impact your credit score.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>How do you find the right pre-qualified credit card offer?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Checking to see if you are pre-qualified for credit card offers with the Discover website is a
                    great first step.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you have pre-qualified offers, pay close attention to fees, APR (including any promotional
                    rates), rewards programs and balance transfer offers. While finding a card that can immediately
                    provide you with an introductory rewards bonus or a promotional rate for a limited duration, be
                    sure to understand the long-term impact of the card on your financial future.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When you decide on your best credit card offer, your full application will include a hard inquiry
                    that could affect your credit score.
                </p>
    <h4 class="field-label"><b>What are the benefits of pre-qualified credit card offers?</b></h4>
                <p>
                    There are several benefits of checking for pre-qualified credit card offers with the free Discover
                    pre-qualification form:
                </p>
                <ul id="benefits-of-prequalified-offers">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            See your unique credit card offers. By using pre-qualification before applying, you can see
                            available credit card offers that match your credit profile.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Instead of submitting a full credit card application that triggers a hard inquiry on your
                            credit report, financial institutions usually will place a soft inquiry on your credit
                            report when you request pre-qualified offers, but check with financial institution. Soft
                            inquiries won’t impact your credit score, but hard inquiries can.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Pre-qualified credit card offers help you find the right card for you.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Prepare your full credit card application. Using a pre-approval process can help gather the
                            information that will build your full application, meaning your application is much easier
                            to complete because the information you submitted when you requested your pre-approved
                            offer is already on file.
                        </p>
